**Little Lemon App** is a capstone project developed as part of the **Meta React Native Specialization** on Coursera. This mobile application simulates a restaurant experience, allowing users to log in, browse the menu, and manage their profile information. 

## Key Features:
- **Menu Browsing:** The app fetches and displays menu items from an external **REST API**.
- **Data Persistence:** Menu data is stored locally using **SQLite** for offline access, and the user's information are stored locally using **AsyncStorage**
- **Profile Management:** Users can update their profile information (e.g., contact details), which is also stored locally using **AsyncStorage**.
- **State Management:** Utilized React Native hooks like `useContext`, `useState`, and `useEffect` to manage application state efficiently.
- **Full Development Lifecycle:** Designed and implemented the application from the ground up, including integrating APIs, managing local storage, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used:
- **Programming Languages:** JavaScript
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React Native, React Navigation
- **Data Storage:** 
  - `SQLite` (for local menu data)
  - `AsyncStorage` (for user profile data)
- **API Integration:** 
  - Fetched menu data from a REST API endpoint using the `fetch` method.
  - Processed JSON responses using `JSON.parse` to convert data into JavaScript objects.
  - Used `JSON.stringify` to prepare data for local storage in AsyncStorage and SQLite.
- **State Management:** React Native hooks (`useContext`, `useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Development Tools:** 
  - **Expo:** Used for development, testing, and running the app on both iOS and Android platforms.
  - **Visual Studio Code:** Primary code editor with extensions for React Native development.

## Skills:
- **Database Management:** Overcame initial challenges with **SQLite** and **AsyncStorage** by learning database syntax and understanding how data is stored and retrieved.
- **State Management Across Screens:** Implemented **useContext** to share and update state between different screens.
- **API Integration:** Learned to fetch data from REST APIs and process JSON responses.
- **Debugging & Problem-Solving:** Troubleshot issues with database queries and state management.
- **Adaptability:** Quickly learned React Native hooks (`useContext`, `useState`, `useEffect`) and applied them effectively.
